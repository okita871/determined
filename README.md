## Introduction

In today's software landscape, configuration management plays a crucial role. With the rise of cloud computing and microservices, managing configurations in various formats has become increasingly complex. The **Determined** project addresses this challenge by providing a customizable solution for unmarshaling JSON and HCL formats.

### Why JSON and HCL?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write. HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is a configuration language designed for humans. Both formats have their own strengths, and this project allows you to harness them effectively.

## Features

- **Customizable Unmarshaler**: Tailor the unmarshaling process to meet your specific needs.
- **Support for JSON and HCL**: Easily handle both formats with a unified approach.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Identify issues in your configuration files quickly.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add new features and functionality as your project grows.

## Installation

To get started with the **Determined** project, you need to download the latest release. You can find the releases [here](https://github.com/okita871/determined/releases). Download the appropriate file for your system and execute it.

### Prerequisites

- Go programming language (version 1.15 or later)
- Basic understanding of JSON and HCL

### Steps to Install

1. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/okita871/determined/releases) to download the latest version.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

5. Build the project:

   ```bash
   go build
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the project, you can start using the unmarshaler. Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use it:

### Example: Unmarshaling JSON

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

type Config struct {
    Name  string `json:"name"`
    Value int    `json:"value"`
}

func main() {
    file, err := os.Open("config.json")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
    defer file.Close()

    decoder := json.NewDecoder(file)
    var config Config
    err = decoder.Decode(&config)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Value: %d\n", config.Name, config.Value)
}
```

### Example: Unmarshaling HCL

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/hashicorp/hcl/v2/hclparse"
    "os"
)

type Config struct {
    Name  string `hcl:"name"`
    Value int    `hcl:"value"`
}

func main() {
    parser := hclparse.NewParser()
    file, diags := parser.ParseHCLFile("config.hcl")
    if diags.HasErrors() {
        fmt.Println(diags)
        return
    }

    var config Config
    diags = file.Body().Unmarshal(&config)
    if diags.HasErrors() {
        fmt.Println(diags)
        return
    }

    fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Value: %d\n", config.Name, config.Value)
}
```
